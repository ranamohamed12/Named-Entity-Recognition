# Named-Entity-Recognition
This project implements a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system using the BERT model. NER is a sub-task of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, and more. The project utilizes the CoNLL-2003 dataset, a widely used dataset for training NER systems. It contains data annotated with four entity types: PER (Person), ORG (Organization), LOC (Location), and MISC (Miscellaneous).
